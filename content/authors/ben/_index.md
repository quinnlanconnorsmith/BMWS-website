I am a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point studying walleye habitat use in three northern Wisconsin lakes. My current project involves archival tagging and acoustic telemetry to evaluate walleye temperature and light-at-depth use. My other research interests include trophic ecology of sportfish and fisheries management.
